# Rotgard
I coded Rotgard using the Godot 4.0 Beta game engine for the 2023 Global Game Jam. This demo shows the main features that I was able to implement within the time constraints: a 3rd person character controller and camera, sound effects proportionate to speed, an animated Robot character (created in Blender), and the battery dying mechanic.
